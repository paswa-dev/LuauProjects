# Directory
1. DebuggingMenu.luau
  - Essentially what the title says, a small debugging menu (before you ask if this is copying deadline, not its not)
2. Destruction.luau
  - Has some edge-cases, but allows for total destruction of parts and is super performant. Uses a quadtree to manage the entire data structure.
3. PlanetGeneration.luau
  - Uses a unitized cube to create a sphere, each face can have an adjustable LOD.
4. Projectile.luau
  - Outdated projectile module, good for people starting off with this stuff.
5. SpaceGame
  - Quite literally a space game that is completely unfinished, also good for people starting off.
6. StressScreenShake.luau
  - Implimentation of GDC Perlin Screen Shake, super duper nice shake.
7. Tagging.luau
  - Interesting way of managing objects in the world.
8. UnfinishedPrototypeWeaponSystem.luau
  - Super good for starters, heavily unfinished viewmodel system for a weapon system. This one copies Tarkov's recoil patterns by using the mouse location as a LookVector, well, a "virual" mouse location. If you read the code you'll understand what I mean.

# I am a proud contributor and helper to the Fireteam development team. Kongo I hope the game goes well.
